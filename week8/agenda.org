* Agenda
 + Packaging an array and a size together in a struct
 + What is a queue?
   + FIFO: First-in, first-out
   + This means we need to put data on one end and take it out from the other
 + Arrays as queues
 + Linked lists
   + One of those really important tricks in CS
   + You use pointers to connect a sequence of nodes
   + Inserting at the beginning is easy
   + Inserting at the end is /slightly/ harder
 + Linked lists as queues!
 + Your assignment: take this code and turn it into stacks instead of queues
   + stacks are LIFO
   + last-in-first out
   + so you *push* and *pop* data from the same end instead of opposite ends
   + Hints:
     + For arrays there's an easier and a harder end to use as the top of the stack! If it seems hard, try the other!
     + For linked lists this should be /really/ simple, don't overthink it
