# Week 07: Memory Practice

Monsters now live in a dynamic array that resizes when one is defeated.

## New in this week
- Dynamic arrays of structs
- Manual resizing with `new[]` and `delete[]`
- Multiple monsters on the map

## Build and run

```bash
make
./game
```

## Files
- `map.txt` provides the dungeon layout
- `save.txt` is created when you save
