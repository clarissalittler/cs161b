# Week 04: File I/O and Saves

The map now loads from a file, and you can save/load player state.

## New in this week
- Read map data from `map.txt`
- Save and load player state (`save.txt`)
- Continue using skills and combat

## Build and run

```bash
g++ -Wall -g main.cpp -o game
./game
```

## Files
- `map.txt` provides the dungeon layout
- `save.txt` is created when you save
