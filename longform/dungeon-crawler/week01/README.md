# Week 01: Player Name (C-Strings)

This week adds a player name stored in a null-terminated C-string.

## New in this week
- `char name[]` with `cin.getline`
- Simple string length check with `strlen`
- Victory message uses the player name

## Build and run

```bash
g++ -Wall -g main.cpp -o game
./game
```
