# Week 00: Basic Movement

This is the simplest version of the game. It uses a fixed 2D array for the map and a loop to move the player.

## New in this week
- 2D arrays for the map
- Basic input handling
- Movement with bounds and wall checks
- A simple win condition

## Build and run

```bash
g++ -Wall -g main.cpp -o game
./game
```

## Controls
- `w` `a` `s` `d` to move
- `q` to quit
