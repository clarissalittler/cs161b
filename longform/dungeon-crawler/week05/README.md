# Week 05: Separate Compilation

This week splits the game into multiple files with a shared `Game` struct.

## New in this week
- `game.h` and `game.cpp`
- A Makefile build
- Reuse file I/O and saves

## Build and run

```bash
make
./game
```

## Files
- `map.txt` provides the dungeon layout
- `save.txt` is created when you save
