* Agenda
 + Arrays and pointers (redux)
   + The type of pointers
   + How to use a pointers
   + What's the point (haha)
   + Why you don't have to pass arrays by reference
 + Arrays of characters
   + (I'm so sorry for what I must do)
   + Wave goodbye to the string type
   + Null-terminated C-style strings
   + Writing functions on C-strings
   + Setting C-strings

* Arrays of characters
 + we can represent strings as char[]
 + each character array has *a fixed size*
 + /but/ we want character arrays to be flexible in the size of the message
 + so we declare a biiiig character array that's the size of the maximum message
 + use \0 (the null character) to mean "this is the end of what I'm currently using in the array"
