# Assignment 5: Refactoring

If you've taken cs161A with me you know what the final assignment is!

That's right, it's the *refactoring assignment* where you take a prior assignment, fix it, add features, &c. in order to clean it up.

This time, though, the requirement of the refactoring assignment is that you take assignment 2, 3, or 4 refactor it to improve it in some way given what you've learned in this class. You can take optional material from the final videos and apply that, you can fix bugs, or you can take ideas we talked about in assignment feedback and expand your prior work.

Really, any way you want to improve, fix, or add some flair to your assignment will count for the purposes of this final project.

Here are some concrete ideas:

- Take data that wasn't encapsulated in a structure and turn it into one
- Take repeated code and put that into a function
- Add more events and room types in your maze game
- Add another kind of filter or transformation in your image processor
- Add features to your stack program like the ability to remove multiple elements at once or to reorder the top two elements
- You can turn your stack program into one that works on any data type using templates

This is supposed to be a low-stress assignment and opportunity to improve prior scores.

This assignment is graded specially because if you get a higher grade on this assignment than the one you refactored you'll bring your grade up for the old assignment too!

## Reflection questions:

This is also going to be a little bit different. For this assignment, write a few sentences on what you've learned in the class and how you think you've grown as a programmer.
