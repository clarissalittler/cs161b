* Agenda
** Anouncement
 + So coding assignment 3 is due not this weeked, but next
 + February 22
 + Please start early and consult the videos/lectures
 + There are a lot of hints but you're going to be kinda lost if you don't look at the P1 parser first
** Stacks, queues, and abstract data
*** What is an abstract data type
 + Encapsulation
 + "You don't have to worry about what's *in* the data, just how you use it"
 + Every abstract data type has an /interface/
 + The interface is the signature of all the functions that can interact with it
   + i.e. what operations exist on the data
 + Abstract data types you know
   + files
   + streams
   + vectors
   + string
 + Not abstract!
   + arrays
*** What is a queue
 + FIFO: first in, first out
 + the British call our shopping lines queues
*** What operations should a queue have?
 + we should be able to check its length
 + we should be able to add something to the end of the queue
 + we should be able to remove from the front of the queue
 + we should be able to print all the elements of the queue in order
*** How can we implement this?
**** Arrays
**** Linked Lists
*** Array implementation of queues
*** Talking through the logic of the linked list
*** Some linked list idioms
*** A linked list implementation
