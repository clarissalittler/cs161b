** c-strings
In 161A, you dealt with the C++ string datatype. This had a lot of nice affordances.

It had a notion of *length*

You could access characters one-by-one via array syntax

It came with a bunch of very convenient features
** "Variable length" arrays, redux
You can either have a size paired as a second variable for each piece of data

OR

you can be *clever* 
** Char arrays (I'm sorry)
Rather than have a size, you have a special character to signify the end of the string

That character is '\0'

Review: characters are /8 bits/ i.e. one byte

'\0' = 0000 0000

'\0' => the null character

c-strings are "null terminated strings"

Rather than a size, we just put a '\0' at the end to say that it's the end of the string

** Writing utilities on char arrays
*** length
*** equality
*** concatenation
*** copying
*** substring
** A game of hangman
